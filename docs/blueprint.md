## Original User Request:
Design and build a clean, professional homepage for my website Toolshub4u, inspired by the layout and design of GitHub.com. The UI should look modern, developer-friendly, and tech-savvy. Use Tailwind CSS for styling. The theme should be a dark mode-first design with deep blue and shiny dark gradients. Key requirements:

     - "Categories" dropdown with a hover-triggered dropdown menu.
     - "Submit Tool" (for users to add new tools).
     - "Dark/Light Mode" toggle (with smooth transition).
   - Navbar background should blend well with page, but still stand out slightly using subtle border or shadow.

   - Bold headline like: “Your Ultimate Hub for Free Online Tools.”
   - Subheadline: “AI Tools, PDF Converters, Resume Builders and more – all in one place.”

   - On hover, categories expand slightly or change background subtly.

6. **Why Toolshub4u? Section:**
